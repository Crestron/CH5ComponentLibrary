<h1>data-ch5-appendclass</h1>
<p>
    The 'data-ch5-appendclass' custom HTML attribute appends the value of a signal to the 'class' attribute on a
    standard HTML element. A change in the value of the signal will remove the prior value of the signal and append
    the new value. As example, for an alarm system application is to have text display state of "Armed Away" until
    homeowner opens a door in which there is a short period to enter a code. During the period of entering code,
    the text of "Armed Away" turns red and blinks on and off. After code is entered, the display state is "Unarmed"
    and the text no longer is red and blinks on and off.
    <br><br>
    Initially the signals are as follows:
    Signal security_system_mode_text is set to "Armed Away" and signal security_system_mode_class is set to empty "".
    When door is opened Signal security_system_mode_class is changed to "blinking_red" which changes the "Armed Away"
    color to red and alternating visibility based upon the class "blinking_red" added to the span elements CSS class
    list. When code is entered, Signal security_system_mode_text is set to "Unarmed" and signal
    security_system_mode_class is set to empty "".
