# Crestron CH5 Developer Scripts
- The package.json file present in this folder contains shortcuts for quickly installing dependencies and other scripts 
which perform more than one command.
- The scripts are prefixed by a number, for easier autocomplete.
- These scripts should **NOT** be used outside local development (no Azure, no references in other scripts) as 
they exist solely with the purpose of speeding up local development by providing shortcuts for what would normally be 
more than 1 command.
