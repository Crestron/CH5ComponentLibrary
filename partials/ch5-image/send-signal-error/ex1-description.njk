<h1><b>sendEventOnError</b> attribute</h1>
<p>
   Open the browser console to confirm when an error occurs while loading the image URL, an error string is sent through a
   signal named image_error. This will trigger a change in <b>receive_image_url</b> to  "http://via.placeholder.com/350x150".
   (See Emulator section above.)
